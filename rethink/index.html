  <p class = "abstractText">
  In this paper, we examine the long-neglected yet important effects of point sampling patterns in point cloud GANs.  Through extensive experiments, we show that sampling-insensitive discriminators (e.g. PointNet-Max) produce shape point clouds with point clustering artifacts while sampling-oversensitive discriminators (e.g. PointNet++, DGCNN) fail to guide valid shape generation.  We propose the concept of sampling spectrum to depict the different sampling sensitivities of discriminators.  We further study how different evaluation metrics weigh the sampling pattern against the geometry and propose several perceptual metrics forming a sampling spectrum of metrics. Guided by the proposed sampling spectrum,we discover a middle-point sampling-aware baseline discriminator, PointNet-Mix, which improves all existing point cloud generators by a large margin on sampling-related metrics.  We point out that, though recent research has been focused on the generator design, the main bottleneck of point cloud GAN actually lies in thediscriminator design. Our work provides both suggestions and tools for building future discriminators. We will release the code to facilitate future research.

            Figure 1. <b>Sampling Specturm.</b> We visualize the behavior of different discriminators when judging four different chair point clouds. (a) and (b) are generated results, (c) and (d) are point clouds sampled using FPS and uniform sampling from a real chair surface. When training the discriminators on data like (d), different discriminators make distinct decisions on the point cloud realness forming a sampling spectrum ranging from sampling-insensitive, sampling-aware to sampling-oversensitive. We advocate sampling- aware discriminators in the middle of the spectrum, which provide good guidance for fixing geometric flaws (a) and big sample artifacts (b) and tolerate subtle sampling differences between (c) and (d).
